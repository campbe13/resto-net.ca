      banner_header: Request the publication of restaurant health inspection reports
      banner_body: In Québec, restaurant health inspection reports aren’t published, so it’s impossible to let you know whether a restaurant passed inspection or received a warning. Only fines are published, on average one year after the infraction or offence. It’s therefore likely that you’ve eaten in restaurants that recently received warnings or fines without knowing!
