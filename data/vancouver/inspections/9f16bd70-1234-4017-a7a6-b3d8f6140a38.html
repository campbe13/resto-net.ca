            Routine inspection conducted with Senior EHO, B. Johnston. Results were discussed with owners Thuy and Andy. 

Sanitation and food handling methods were again found to be poor. Owners have been advised that they can no longer continue to operate their facility in this manner. Discussion took place with the owners regarding concerns, items requiring completion, future expectations, and future consequences for continued non-compliance. 

The following items must be addressed IMMEDIATELY:
1. Repair dishwasher so that it is achieving a final rinse chlorine concentration of >50 ppm
2. Clean and sanitize the ENTIRE facility thoroughly. This includes all corners, equipment, walk-in cooler and freezer, and hard-to-reach areas.
3. Develop a detailed sanitation plan outlining daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly tasks

Operator has been given 2 weeks to have all items completed. Re-inspection will be conducted on December 28th. All corrective actions must be completed in full by then. 

FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN FURTHER ACTION SUCH AS TICKETING, CLOSURE, PERMIT SUSPENSION/RESTRICTION.
