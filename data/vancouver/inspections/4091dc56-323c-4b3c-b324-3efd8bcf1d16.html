                       <p>Various bins were double stacked in the walk-in cooler and in the prep-cooler.  This issue was corrected at the time of the inspection.  

Light covers are missing for three of the light fixtures in the kitchen.
i) above dim-sum cooking area
ii) above deep fryer area
iii) above the stainless steel table next to the dim-sum cooking area  

Fan grill in the slim walk-in freezer was accumulated in dirt and debris.  
Fan grill in the walk-in cooler was accumulated with dirt and debris.

A Table cloth was used to shield vegetables from the frigid cold in the walk-in cooler to prevent cold damage.  However, the cloth was observed to have major spots of mould.  Fortunately, non of the foods were in direct contact with the mould.  Nevertheless, this was corrected at the time of the inspection.</p>
                   
                       <p>Ensure that if food items are to be double-stacked for storage, proper food-grade covers or saran wrap is used to prevent food from being in direct contact with the bottom of the bins.  Failure to do so will contaminate the food.  
Ensure that all lights in the kitchen area are properly fitted with a safety shield.  In case of accidental breakage, the shield will prevent glass shards from contaminating the food and injuring customers.  
Ensure that fan grills accumulated in dirt and debris are dismantled from its mechanical storage unit and properly cleaned and sanitized to prevent the potential contamination of food.  
Ensure that table clothes are not used to protect food in the cooler as it has the ability to absorb moisture which is likely why spots of mould was observed on the cloth.  Mould has been associated with adverse health effects.</p>

                       <p>Ensure that ceiling tiles remain in place to prevent the potential of falling debris or dirt from above which can potentially contaminate food and/or food contact surfaces.   
Ensure that the leak below the 3 compartment sink is properly taken care of to prevent the accumulation of drainage which can result in unsanitary conditions.  
Ensure that when time is available, remove the broken deep fryer and the microwave to free up space to improve cleaning and sanitizing and proper pest monitoring.</p>
