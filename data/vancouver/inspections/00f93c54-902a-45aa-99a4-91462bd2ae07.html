                       <p>Tongs
At the time of the inspection several tongs were being used for handling raw meat for cooking. These were being stored at room temperature. Tongs should be stored either at +60C or hotter, +4C or colder or in sanitizer. Salads etc were handled by hand without tongs.There must be clear separation between tongs and staff handling raw potentially high risk food and other foods and staff must wash their hands regularly using hot water and soap. 

Ice Scoop
The ice scoop for the ice machine should be stored in the ice with the handle not in contact with the ice. 

Milk Fridge
The fridge used to store jugs of milk was wet and it appeared that condensate water dripping from the inside of the fridge and may contaminate the open jugs of milk. This fridge should now be repaired/replaced and the milk covered whilst in storage.</p>

The steam table presently being used in combination with ice to keep food cold is not acceptable and does not control food temperature adequately. Food was measured at between +10 and +15C. This equipment should now be removed and replaced with mechanical refrigeration equipment to ensure food is maintained at +4C or colder. THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION

Drawer Fridge
The food within the drawer fridge was measured at +10C. This equipment should now be replaced to ensure a food temperature of +4C or colder.

Freezer
The walk-in freezer was measured at -6.5C. This should now be repaired to ensure a maximum temperature of -18C at all times.</p>

Both degreaser for cleaning and sanitizer for disinfecting should be provided in clearly labeled spray bottles for example and routinely refreshed. 

Wiping Cloths
Wiping cloths used for wiping food contact surfaces should be clean, dedicated in use and stored in sanitizer when not being used.</p>

There was evidence of rat activity at the facility. Rat droppings were noted in the vicinity of the open drain adjacent the redundant ice machine within the basement area and in the hot water tank room within the basement area. Mice holes were observed in the banquet hall area. The facility should now be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized especially in those areas that are harder to reach and including those areas that are seldom disturbed (in the basement). The services of a pest control contractor should be sought for advice and action in eradicating rats and mice from the facility and a written report provided for EHO inspection. The open drain adjacent the ice machine in the basement should now be sealed to prevent rat access.  THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION 

Mop Bucket
At the time of the inspection the mop bucket was being stored with dirty cold mop water within it from the previous evening. This will encourage flies and should not be left in this condition after use.</p>

The ice cream freezer must now and routinely be defrosted and cleaned.

Bar Floor /Ice Sinks
The floor of the bar area particularly beneath sinks and refrigeration equipment was in need of routine cleaning. The ice sink should be fully drained, cleaned (including beneath the soft drink heat exchanger block) and sanitized at the start of each days use.

Banquet Bar
The ice sinks within the banquet bar were dirty and it appeared  that proper cleaning of the sinks was not being carried out. Sinks must be fully cleaned and sanitized at the start of each days use.</p>

                       <p>Cleaning
The cleaning generally throughout the kitchen and the basement food storage areas was poor. All areas of the facility must be routinely cleaned including the more difficult to reach areas including beneath work equipment, shelves, fridges, stoves and sinks.

Fridge Door Seals
Some of the fridge door edge seals (gaskets) of the reach-in fridges on the front line are split and in poor condition making them impossible to clean effectively. These must now be replaced leaving a smooth and cleanable surface.  

Floor Repairs
The floor area beneath the dishwasher was wet and water was pooling. Water must be routinely mopped up to prevent risk of pests and the floor damage in this area should now be repaired leaving a smooth and cleanable surface.</p>

At the time of the inspection there was not hand soap provided at the wash hand station in the rear food prep area where raw ground beef was being handled. All wash hand stations must be fully provided with hot and cold running water, liquid hand soap and towels at all times.

Food Separation
Within the walk-in cooler there must be clear separation of raw potentially high risk food from other food. 

Day/Date Labeling
For good stock control and food status awareness, prepared or thawed food must be day/date labeled.</p>
