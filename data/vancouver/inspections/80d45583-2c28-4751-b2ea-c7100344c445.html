            Third request for a follow-up after a closure on Dec 19th due to a rodent infestation and insanitary conditions. Inspection conducted at 9am and accompanied by Owner, My Duong.

At the time of inspection still some existing rodent droppings were still observed (i.e. under front counter area, under mop sink, and under the white prep table) and some new rodent droppings (on front counter near microwave, in the back of the tea cannister, on shelving underneath, and in the back hallway, and under the white prep table), All droppings were removed at the time of inspection and surfaces were sanitized. 

Some additional grease on the wall behind the deep fryer and the side of the dishwashing sink were to be cleaned/sanitized. Completed at the time of inspection. The grill machine still requires a deep clean (especially in the back where all the scrapings are). This is to be completed today. 

A new weatherstrip was installed on the front door however, there was still a >1/4 inch gap in the corner where the door opens up. To be filled today. Considering the new droppings from overnight, the EHO inspected for any new holes. The EHO identified a few holes in the bottom of the doorway of the back storage room (coming from the basement) and in the bathroom around piping. These are to be filled today with steel wool or insulation foam. 

There is a leak coming from one of the piping out of deep fryer and therefore there is a new puddle of grease. This leak must be fixed asap. 

At the start of each day the Owner (or delegate) must meticulously inspect the premise everywhere for signs of pest activity. Use your flash light for inspecting areas that are not well lit. Clean-up droppings with papertowel and after the droppings have been removed, clean and disinfect the area (with >100ppm chlorine) for a contact time of 5 minutes, especially food preparation surfaces and utensils that may have been soiled. The urine is not visible, but where there are droppings there will be urine also. Wash hands afterwards.

As per Section 24 (1) of the BC Food Premise Regulation "Every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure the safe and sanitary operation of the establishment. (2) The written procedures required by subsection (1) must include (a) the cleaning and sanitizing requirements for the establishment and for all equipment and utensils used in the establishment, (b) the identification of cleaning and sanitizing agents used in the establishment, including their concentrations and their uses, and (c) the identification of all pesticides used in the establishment, including their uses and their storage requirements".</p>

            <h4>
                Inadequate Insect/Rodent Control</h4>
            
                       <p>Rodent infestation observed. Rodent droppings observed:
- All old and new droppings were removed at the time of inspection.  

Have pest control assist with monitoring every 2 weeks for the next few months or until the pest problem is under control and then every month after that.

Note: pest control companies will assist with monitoring however, it is the Owner's responsibility to attend to the daily cleaning, removal of droppings, sanitizing surfaces if contaminated, inspecting foods for contamination, and sealing entrance holes to prevent the access of pests. The amount of rodent droppings observed at the time of inspection and the lack of awareness is not acceptable.</p>
                   
                       <p>Owner/Operator must:
1. Inspect and discard any adulterated food (including foods in open containers).
2. Clean and sanitize surfaces contaminated by pests (i.e. by using 1000ppm diluted bleach). Remove all items off of shelving and sanitize shelving and food containers (i.e. plastic bins and cans).
3. Remove all food debris and grease from inside and outside the premises on a daily basis
4. Protect the food premises against the entrance of pests - seal all gaps and holes (move shelving away from walls and fill holes in wall, flooring, and ceiling). Destroy and seal off nests and breeding places.
5. Store all foods (i.e. dry goods, produce, etc...) in containers with tight-fitting lids.
6. Remove all unnecessary clutter. Clutter impedes on cleaning and can be potential harborage sites for pests.

An updated sanitation plan from the Operator will be required which will outline pest control measures that will be taken on a daily basis.</p>
