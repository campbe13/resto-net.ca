                       <p>Ice Sink
The ice sink beneath the heat exchanger plate for the soft drinks was dirty and slime mould was observed. Cans of soft drinks were also being stored within the ice. The ice sink should be drained of ice, cleaned and sanitized after each period of service. Only the ice scoop may also be stored in the ice but the handle must not be in contact with the ice.

Ice Machine
The ice machine was full to the lid with ice and is not ever cleaned. The ice machine should now and routinely be completely emptied of ice and thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. 

Food On Floor
Food was being stored on the floor in several locations throughout the kitchen. Trays of raw meat were observed on the floor thawing, pails of food within the walk-in coolers and freezers and food in trays stored beneath shelves were also observed. To prevent risk of cross contamination of food contact surfaces and risk from pests, no food should ever be stored on the floor.</p>

                       <p>Wooden Chopping Blocks
There are three blocks in use at the kitchen and all were in need of proper cleaning. Wooden chopping blocks are not recommended as these cannot be thoroughly cleaned and cannot be put through a commercial dishwasher. If wooden chopping blocks are used then they must be scraped and scrubbed clean after each period of use and sprayed with sanitizer. Chopping blocks should be routinely planed smooth and flat to provide for easy thorough cleaning. 

Separation of Food
Within the walk-in cooler and within the reach-in coolers raw meat was observed being stored above and in close proximity to other foods, some not intended for further cooking. Fridges should now be arranged to provide clear separation of potentially hazardous food from other foods and should, at all times, be stored on the lowest shelves.</p>

                       <p>Wooden Handles
At the time of the inspection, knives and choppers used on the wooden chopping blocks were dirty and appeared to have not had thorough recent cleaning. Many of these had wooden handles that could not be adequately cleaned and were not suitable for placing within the dishwasher. These should now be removed from the facility and replaced with equipment that can be properly cleaned and sanitized. 

Meat Delivery
At the time of the inspection frozen meat had previously been delivered and was left on the floor without attention. These boxes were likely to have remained in room temperature until at least 5.00pm, (at least three hours) when the evening staff resumed working. To prevent risk of thawing, frozen food should be placed within the freezer immediately after delivery.</p>

At the time of the inspection raw ginger was observed at +12C stored on a food contact surface in front of the stove with no means of cooling. It had allegedly been on a small dish of ice but this had now melted and all food additives/flavours of this type had been left after the lunch time service at room temperature. The ginger was discarded. All potentially hazardous food and food likely to spoil must be covered and stored at +4C or colder at all times.</p>

                       <p>Meat Cooling
At the time of the inspection cooked duck and baby chicken carcasses, uncovered, were being stored on top of food within the dry food storage area to cool. Food was measured at +20C. It is likely that this food would not be placed in a refrigerator until at least 5.00pm when kitchen staff returned for the evening shift. All cooked potentially hazardous food should be cooled to +20C within two hours and then to +4C or colder within a further four hours. To prevent risk from pests, insects and other contamination food should not be left to cool unprotected. A proper place should now be provided for cooling food in a protected environment.</p>

Generally cleaning at the facility was poor. All areas of the kitchen should now and routinely be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized including but not limited to; floors in the more difficult to reach areas, walls especially in areas where food is prepared, all shelves including those not used for storing food, reach-in fridges (including fridge door edge seals) and the walls and floors of the walk-in cooler and freezer.  THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION

The water leak beneath the bar sink should now be repaired to prevent risk from pests.</p>

The kitchen staff had left the kitchen after the lunch time service without carrying out any basic cleaning. Food contact surfaces were left dirty including chopping blocks.

The inspection was carried out mid afternoon. At the time of the inspection a large amount of dirty plates were left from the lunch time service stored on the floor and any flat place in the facility of the dishwashing area awaiting afternoon/evening staff to arrive and carry out washing up duties. Whilst this is not a critical hazard,  I recommend that you scrape food scraps from the plates and have a proper place to store them off of the floor.  

Hand Washing Stations
At the time of the inspection proper provision of clean dry hand towels was not provided at the wash hand station at the bar sink or at the servers/bussing wash hand sink. Clean dry hand towels should now be provided, small light napkins or toilet paper is not acceptable to encourage good hand washing practices.</p>
