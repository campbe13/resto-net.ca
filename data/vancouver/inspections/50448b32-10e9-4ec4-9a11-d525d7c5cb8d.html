Daily temperature records are required to ensure that refrigerators are operating below the 4C standard to prevent the growth of pathogenic microorganisms.

The manager was not aware of the existence of a Food Safety Plan.  A written information package was provided to the manager to help him prepare a plan.
Ensure an up to date Food Safety Plan is in place and approved by your inspector by December 2nd, 2011.</p>
                   
                       <p>Monitor and record cooler temperatures daily.

The Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99) section 23 requires that: "every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment."</p>

Large pieces of fish were observed to be held in one side of the small kitchen two compartment sink.  This sink did not appear to be perfectly clean.  Staff were directed to not put sushi fish directly into the sinks, but to hold the fish in clean containers.

The raw tuna was being cut on cutting boards covered with paper rice bags that had been cut open.  Staff were directed to only process the food on clean and sanitized cutting boards.</p>
                   
                       <p>Ensure compliance with section 12 of the Food Premises Regulations (B.C. Reg. 210/99): 

Every operator of food premises must ensure that all food on the premises is 
(a) protected from contamination, and
(b) stored, handled, prepared, displayed and dispensed in a sanitary manner.

                       <p>An insert full of cooked chicken was observed "cooling" at room temperature in the cooking area.  Staff were told to cool cooked food in more shallow layers in metal pans that are more shallow.

Hot potentially hazardous foods, that will not be held hot, must be cooled quickly.
Hot food must cool from 60 C to 21 C within a TWO hour period and from 20 C to 4 C within an additional FOUR hours.

In order to meet this requirement action must be taken to ensure food is cooled quickly.  Passively cooling food at room temperature for many hours is not acceptable.

Recommendations on how to cool foods rapidly:

>Divide large volumes of hot food into multiple smaller containers.  Shallow pans are recommended.
>Ice baths or ice wands may be used.
>Stir cooling foods often.
>Refrigerate (may not cool large quantities of food quickly).</p>
