                       <p>Ensure that a Food Safety Plan (approved by your inspector) is in place in the restaurant.

The Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99) section 23 requires that: "every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment."</p>
                   
                       <p>Temperatures of coolers are now bieng monitored AND recorded as required by a functioning Food Safety Plan.

A Food Safety Plan is required by law to be present in the restaurant.  Please prepare a Food Safety Plan for approval by your inspector, that describes in detail how food is prepared safely in the restaurant, including all steps from receiving the food, food storage, cooking, hot holding, cooling, reheating etc.  This plan is due no later than August 14th, 2011.</p>

            <h4>
                Inadequate Cooling and/or Refrigerated Storage of Potentially Hazardous Food(s)</h4>
            
                       <p>The operatore was directed to verify that the cooling methods being used work, according to the requirements above.  The operator must use a sanitized probe style thermometer to monitor the temperature of cooling food to ensure that the food cools within the required time frames.

Ensure compliance with section 14 of the Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99):

14 (1)  Every operator of food premises that processes food must ensure that the food is processed in a manner that makes it safe to eat. 
(2)  Every operator of food premises must ensure that potentially hazardous food is stored or displayed at a temperature of not more than 4�C or not less than 60�C.</p>
                   
                       <p>Multiple containers of hot soup were observed to be cooling passively on a shelf in the kitchen.  The operator says that she allows the food to cool passively at room temperature for a while and then puts the containers of warm food directly into a small chest freezer.

Hot potentially hazardous foods, that will not be held hot, must be cooled quickly.
Hot food must cool from 60 C to 21 C within a TWO hour period and from 20 C to 4 C within an additional FOUR hours.

In order to meet this requirement action must be taken to ensure food is cooled quickly.  Passively cooling food at room temperature for many hours is not acceptable.

Recommendations on how to cool foods rapidly:

>Divide large volumes of hot food into multiple smaller containers.  Shallow pans are recommended.
>Ice baths or ice wands may be used.
>Stir cooling foods often.
>Refrigerate (may not cool large quantities of food quickly).</p>

Potentially hazardous foods may not be held in this cooler unless it has been fixed/adjusted and is holding food at 4 C or below as required.

Ensure that every cooler has an accurrate dedicated thermometer.</p>

Ensure that the pest control company is providing a written explanation of what services were done, what pest activity was noted, and recommendations for further reducing/eliminating pest activity.  Keep these reports on site.

The operator must comply with section 26 of the Food Premises Regulations:
Every operator of food premises must ensure that the premises are 
(a) free of pests,
(b) free of conditions that lead to the harbouring or breeding of pests, and
(c) protected against the entrance of pests.</p>
