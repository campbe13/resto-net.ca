The business is required by law to have an up to date Food Safety Plan that details how food is safely handled from receipt to sale or consumption.  This plan must include the identification of critical control points (CCPs) and critical control limits (CCLs) which must be monitored daily and documented.  The plan must describe the process followed to ensure adherence to the critical limits, and the actions to be taken in the event that the critical limits are not adhered to.</p>
                   
                       <p>The Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99) section 23 requires that: "every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment."</p>

                       <p>The temperature of the hot held chicken in the chicken hot holding case is being measured by using an infrared thermometer on the outside top of the clear plastic dome container.  This will not give an accurrate idea of the chicken temperature.  Temperatures are being recorded as being well below the required 60 C.  

Staff were directed to test that the hot holiding display case is effective at keepting the chickent hot (above 60 C), by routinely using a sanitized probe style thermometer to measure the temperature of the chicken.  After cooking,  the chickens will remain hot for some time, so to determine if the hot holding unit is effective, check the internal temperature of the chicken a few hours after cooking to ensure that the chicken is still above 60 C as required.

I would recommend using single use alcohol swabs/wipes (available at the drug store) to sanitize the probe thermometer.</p>
                   
                       <p>Potentially hazardous foods being held hot must be held at 60 C or greater to prevent bacterial growth.  The temperature of hot foods must be monitored with a sanitized probe style thermometer.

Ensure compliance with section 14 of the Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99):

14 (1) Every operator of food premises that processes food must ensure that the food is processed in a manner that makes it safe to eat. 
(2)  Every operator of food premises must ensure that potentially hazardous food is stored or displayed at a temperature of not more than 4�C or not less than 60�C.</p>
