            Routine follow-up conducted mid-afternoon. Accompanied by staff, Andrew and Angela.

Previous deficiencies are still outstanding.
- lack of thermometer in cooler and monitoring
- time/temperature of tapioca balls at ambient temperatures is not being recorded. Spoke to staff member and it takes an hour to an hour and a half to make a fresh batch. The batch they had at ambient temperature had almost been sitting at ambient temperature for 2 hrs (temperature 25-26 degrees C) and yet the staff hadn't even started to make a new batch of tapioca balls.
- a sanitizer solution was not available. Dirty wiping cloths were sitting on the counter. Instructed staff member how to prepare a diluted bleach solution for storing wiping cloths and to use on food contact surfaces throughout the day to prevent contamination of foods and maintain the premise in a sanitary condition. Received resistance from the staff member and did not want to store wiping cloths in diluted bleach or prepare any for use because the Owner has not instructed them to do so. Throughout the day they just use soap on surfaces and for wiping cloths and they just use diluted bleach on surfaces and the floor in the morning and at night. Dirty and wet wiping cloths can act as a reservior for pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc..) which are not destroyed by using soap.
- a few staff members may be registered for the Foodsafe course.

Tapioca balls are a potentially hazardous food (i.e. capable of supporting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms) and must be kept out of the dangerzone (between 4 and 60 degrees C) otherwise discarded after 2hrs. Spoke with staff and the tapioca balls are delivered daily (in the am) and are kept at ambient temperature all day until used up and then any leftovers are discarded.</p>
                   
                       <p>Owner/Operator must ensure that all potentially hazardous foods are stored at 4 degrees C or less or 60 degrees C or greater at all times. Otherwise, after 2 hours discard. Therefore, Owner must keep small batches in the cooler and bring out as the other is discarded and/or make own batches of balls frequently throughout the day.</p>
