Both degreaser for cleaning and sanitizer for disinfecting should be readily available, in clearly labeled spay bottles for example, for cleaning and sanitizing respectively.

Wiping cloths should be clean, dedicated in use and when not in use, stored in sanitizer.

The food slicer should be cleaned and sanitized after use and should not be left for more than two hours between cleaning.</p>

Wiping Cloths
Cloths used for wiping food contact surfaces were observed dirty and stored on food contact surfaces at room temperature.

These are dirty and are not being routinely cleaned.

Cleaning 
Generally cleaning at the facility is poor.

Grease Filters
The grease filters were heavily laden with grease and appeared never to be cleaned.

Hood Lights
The two light fittings within the exhaust ventilation system are not working.</p>
                   
                       <p>Freezers should now be defrosted and cleaned and carried out routinely.

All floors beneath and behind work equipment, walls, shelves and all work equipment should be routinely cleaned and sanitized.

To prevent risk of contaminating food from dripping grease and to prevent risk of poor air quality within the kitchen environment, the grease filters should be cleaned at least once per week (or more often as necessary).

For good cleaning practices and for reasons of health and safety practice, the light fittings should now be repaired.</p>
