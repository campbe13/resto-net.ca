At the time of the inspection tongs used for dispensing/handling food were observed on the food contact surfaces at room temperature. To prevent risk of cross contamination of foods from bacteria on the tongs, tongs should be stored in ice or in hot water in excess of +60C.</p>

                       <p>Reach-in Freezer
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - The reach-in freezer was measured at between -3.3C and +6C. Food in the freezer was soft when squeezed. The doors do not close and latch efficiently and at the time of the inspection one of the door was open by 2". Staff and management were aware of this problem but failed to take action to repair it. The freezer doors should now be repaired to ensure the freezer is -18C or colder at all times. 
- doors have not been repaired and food temperature still at excess temperature, new hinges said to be on order.

Walk-in Cooler
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED - The walk-in cooler was measured at +7C, it is understood there had been a delivery that day but food that had been in the cooler for several days was measured at +7C. This should now be investigated to ensure a maximum temperature of +4C at all times.</p>

                       <p>Cleaning
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - The cleaning of the kitchen beneath the stove, fat fryer, fridges and shelves etc is poor. No routine cleaning schedule was available. All areas of the facility should now and routinely be thoroughly cleaned in accordance with you written sanitation plan. THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION
- general cleaning appears to have been improved but the floor of the walk-in cooler, in the more difficult to reach areas, is not being cleaned.

Floor
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - The kitchen floor grouting is worn and food and water now collect in the grout lines between the ceramic tiles making the floor difficult to clean effectively. The floor should now be thoroughly cleaned and the grout replaced leaving a smooth, impermeable to water and cleanable surface. THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION
- this is being arranged and is hoped to be completed within two weeks.</p>

                       <p>Grease Trap
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - No grease trap was observed at the facility, this should be identified to the EHO on the follow-up inspection. If one is not installed then, to prevent risk of blockage within waste water plumbing and prevent water use for washing up and hand washing, a grease trap should now be installed.
- no evidence of grease trap or grease trap cleaning provided.

Lock-up
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED - The outdoor lock-up located within the car park is not a permitted food room. It is presently being used to store food as well as recycled materials and there is evidence of mice activity. No lighting is provided within this area. Food should now be removed and this area should no longer be used for storage of food. 
- no food is stored in this area. 

Prep Fridge
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED - The two door reach-in prep fridge has water collecting inside. This should now be investigated and repaired.</p>

THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - The soft drinks containers and apparatus are stored beneath a food preparation area and are now covered in food debris. A plastic cover was installed at the last inspection but this is not preventing food from falling onto the equipment or the floor below and is difficult to clean. This equipment must now be installed within a closed cupboard or removed from this area to a more suitable location. THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION
- new cabinet to house soft drinks apparatus said to be on order.

Work Top
THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED - The food preparation worktop is not sealed to the wall. This should now be sealed to the wall leaving a smooth and cleanable surface.</p>

THE FOLLOWING CONTRAVENTION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - The kitchen does not have a dedicated hand wash station. Presently the two compartment sink in the bar area is also used as a dedicated hand wash station for both bar staff employees, service staff and kitchen staff employees. This is not acceptable,  a dedicated hand wash station with hot and cold running water, liquid and soap and clean dry towels must now be provided within the food preparation area. 
- sink has now been delivered and is hoped to be installed within two weeks.

Gas Cylinders
For reasons of good health and safety practices, the tall pressurized gas cylinders stored within the keg room should either be secured standing or laid flat and choked to prevent risk of injury to staff whilst cleaning.</p>

THE FOLLOWING VIOLATION HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED - At the time of the follow-up inspection, glass bottles of beer and a plastic container of Clamato were being stored in the ice that was intended for public consumption. Only the scoop should be stored within the ice sink.

Rusting Shelves
THE FOLLOWING VIOLATION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - At the time of the follow-up inspection it was observed that the shelves within the walk-in cooler were rusting and incapable of being properly cleaned. These should be replaced or cleaned of rust and sealed leaving smooth and cleanable surfaces.
- new shelving said to be on order

Food On Floor
THE FOLLOWING VIOLATION HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED - At the time of the follow-up inspection food was being stored directly on the floor of the walk-in cooler. To prevent risk of cross contamination of food contact surfaces food must not be stored on the floor.</p>
