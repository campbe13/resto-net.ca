                       <p>Owner must ensure the staff are monitoring the temperatures of all coolers, hot holding, and the dishwasher temperature on a daily basis. 

** EHO requires a copy of the revised Food Safety Plan immediately.</p>
                   
                       <p>On-going/re-occurring observation - Food Safety Plan monitoring is now occurring for the coolers. Staff are not monitoring the temperatures of hot holding or the dishwasher. Procedure for monitoring the time/temperature of tapioca balls must be added to the Food Safety Plan.

Resolved - premise equipped with a probe thermometer. Demonstrated to staff how to check hot holding temperatures and read the dishwasher gauge. Recommended a max hold thermometer or thermolabels to check the dishwasher temperature.</p>

                       <p>1. Re-occurring observation - Food stored or refrigerated in a manner so that cross-contamination occurs. Observed raw meat in up-right glass cooler stored directly above produce/ready-to-eat foods during the follow-up inspection.
2. Resolved - did not observe large volumes of foods cooled in large containers. Large food items and large containers of food, take longer to cool because of the mass and volume from which heat must be removed. Cool potentially hazardous foods in containers with a depth of less than 4 inches. By reducing the volume of the food in an individual container, the rate of cooling is dramatically increased and opportunity for pathogen growth is minimized. Cooling must be from 60C (140F) to 20C (68F) within 2 hours and 20C (68F) to 4C (40F) within 4 hours. If this is not acheived then the food must be discarded. Monitor by using a probe thermometer and record results. Use a ice wand to bring down the temperature of foods rapidly.</p>
                   
                       <p>1. Corrected again at the time of inspection. Raw meat was relocated to the bottom shelf. Refrain from storing raw meat above product or ready-to-eat foods.</p>

2. Resolved - scoops with handles are being used to dispense dry goods. Ensure handles do not come into contact with foods.
3. Resolved - food containers and other storage items are no longer stored on the floor. Store food containers and other items off the floor a minimum of 6 inches to protect foods; to facilitate cleaning of the floors with ease; and for monitoring for signs of pest activity.</p>

                       <p>1. Resolved - adequate amount of approved sanitizer at the time of inspection. Sanitizer in bucket >100ppm chlorine and in labeled spray bottles (>100ppm chlorine). An approved sanitizer (i.e. 100ppm chlorine or 200ppm quaternary ammmonium) must be available at all times when in operation. Use this solution to store dirty wiping cloths, for sanitzing food contact surfaces (after washing) throughout the day to prevent contamination of foods and maintain the premises in santiary conditions. 
2. Resolved - dishwasher final rinse proper temperature. The final rinse temperature for the high temp dishwasher was 72.3 degrees C after 3 runs. Ensure to run the dishwasherat least 2 times prior to the sanitizing run. Mechanical dishwashing procedure must have a final rinse water temperature is > 71 degrees C / 160 degrees F for 10 seconds, measured at the dish; or >82 degrees C/179 degrees F, measured at the manifold for adequate sanitizing of re-usable equipment and utensils.</p>
