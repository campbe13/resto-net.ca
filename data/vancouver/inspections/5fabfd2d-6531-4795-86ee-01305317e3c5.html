                       <p>Food Safety Plan monitoring and recording of cooler and food temperatures is now occurring, but only once per day.  Staff were directed to record temperatures two times daily.

Daily temperature records are required to ensure that coolers are holding foods at 4 C or below and that hot holding units are keeping foods at 60C or above, in order to prevent the growth of pathogenic organisms, which could cause food poisoning.  It is recommended that you take and record at least one temperature record for each cooler and hot holding unit during each period of service. 

Accurate thermometers are not available in all coolers.  Ensure that all coolers are equip with accurate thermometers to ensure that potentially hazardous food is being held at 4 C or below, as required by law.

There are no probe style thermometers available to check the internal temperature of food.  Cooling procedures must be monitored with a probe thermometer.</p>
                   
                       <p>The Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99) section 23 requires that: "every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment." 



Spoke to the owner regarding Food Safety Plan to ensure that it is being formulated.  Owner stated that it would be completed within the next week.  Ensure that all items above and in the information provided is addressed.  Submitt to Ralph Sears.</p>

The manager said that he would consider installing a second hand washing sink in the kitchen cooking area, as renovations are planned for the near future.

The only kitchen hand washing sink was not supplied with paper towel at the time of the inspection.  The dispenser was re-filled during the inspection.</p>
                   
                       <p>Ensure compliance with Section 21 of the Food Premises Regulations:

21(3)  Every operator of food premises must ensure that each employee washes his or her hands as often as necessary to prevent the contamination of food. 
21(4)  Every operator of food premises must supply and maintain handwashing stations adequate in number and location to ensure convenient access to all employees.

Cooling methods have not been verified, using a probe thermometer.

Staff say that the large skink in this area has a functional drain but the sink  does not have a water supply.  Staff were directed to fix the plumbing so that water is supplied at this sink so that ice and water baths may be more easily prepared.</p>
