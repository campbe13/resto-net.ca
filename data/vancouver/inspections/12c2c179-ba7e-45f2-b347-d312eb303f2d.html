Pre-cooked broccoli was being stored at room temperature.  This is not acceptable.  Once cooked, broccoli is a potentially hazardous food and must be stored at 4 degrees C or colder at all times.

BBQ eel and salmon skin were being stored on ice.  This is not sufficient to keep these foods at a safe temperature of 4 degrees C or colder.  BBQ eel and salmon skin must be mechanically refrigerated.

Sushi rolls were being prepared well in advance of the lunch service (10:30 am).  Completed rolls were being stored at room temperature.  No time controls were in use.  This is unacceptable.  All sushi must be mechanically refrigerated until service.

The glasswasher may not be used until it has been serviced and there is 50-100 ppm chlorine in the final rinse cycle.  This concentration must be verified each time the VIP Bar is in operation.

The meat slicer in the main kitchen was filthy.  The slicer must be cleaned and sanitized after each use.  Please refer to the guideline provided for instructions on how to properly clean and sanitize a meat slicer.

The ice boxes in both the VIP Bar and the main Bar were unsanitary.  In addition, the beverages lines intersecting the ice boxes were covered with mildew and the beverage nozzle holders were slimy.  These findings are unacceptable.  Ice intended for human consumption must be protected from contamination at all times.  The ice boxes, beverage lines and beverage nozzle holders must be washed, rinsed and sanitized at the start of EACH day.</p>

A food handler placed raw beef and raw pork onto the grill with his bare hands.  He then proceeded to perform other food handling tasks without ever attempting to wash his hands.  This is UNACCEPTABLE!  Hands must be washed each time raw food is handled, before putting on and taking off gloves, or after coming into contact with any potentially contaminated surface.  Please ensure that all staff are educated in the importance of hand washing. 

Foods were being stored directly on top of other foods without proper lids being in place.  Please note that foods may only be stacked on top of each other if tight-fitting lids are in place to protect the foods from contamination.

Rodent abatement strategies must be increased.  Please refer to the information provided regarding control of mice in food establishments.  Rodent activity must be monitored very closely.  Many of the rodent control devices in this restaurant have been rotated or moved away from the walls.  Please note that moving or rotating the devices even slightly renders them ineffective.  If the devices must be moved to clean the floor, please ensure that they are placed back in their exact position.  Immediate corrective action is required.

Immediate corrective action is also required to abate the fruit flies in the dishwashing area, as well as in the main bar (in the vicinity of the ice box).  Please note that moist conditions are favorable to the proliferation cockroaches and fruit flies.  Eliminate all sources of pooling water.</p>

Thorough cleaning is again required in the dishwash area.  There is still a bad odor in the area, indicative of unsanitary conditions and pooling water.  Ensure that all equipment and walls in the dishwash area, including under the dishwash counter, are thoroughly cleaned.  All deteriorated mats on the floor in the dishwash area must be replaced.   The bus pans are filthy and must be thoroughly cleaned or replaced.  Second Warning.
Cleaning is required under all counters and coolers in the sushi bars.
All wooden blocks under the cutting boards in the sushi bars must be replaced with blocks that are smooth, washable and non-absorbent.  Second Warning.</p>
