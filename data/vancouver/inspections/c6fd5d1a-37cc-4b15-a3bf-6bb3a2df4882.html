                       <p>The food safety plan is a very effective tool but in order for it to be used correctly, it needs to be complete, it needs to be reviewed at least once a year to address any changes that have taken place, and all staff need to be familiar with it.

Temperature monitoring and recording must be done for all  (hot and cold) equipment holding perishable foods. 
Temperature monitoring of final cooking temperatures also needs to take place. 

Critical to the success of any operation is regular verification, by management, of all standard operating procedures to ensure that all procedures are being followed as required.

A record of this activity should also be kept.</p>
                   
                       <p>A food safety plan was provided at the time of inspection, however it needs to be reviewed and updated.

Temperature monitoring is being done of some equipment but not all, and no final cooking and hot holding temperatures are being taken and recorded.</p>

Most of the cutting boards being used at the time of inspection were found worn and as such difficult to properly clean/sanitize.

Two freezers lids are being used for food preparation. This is not a satisfactory use of this equipment.</p>
                   
                       <p>Stacking of any containers can only be done if each container is covered (lids and/or Saran wrap) so as to prevent cross contamination.

All perishable foods must be held at, or below 4 deg. C at all times.
Regular temperature monitoring and recording of perishable foods in these refirigerated units with wells, must be done on a daily basis to ensure safe temperatures are being maintained.

All worn cutting boards need to be replaced.
The lids of the freezers cannot be used for food preparation purposes.</p>

Every hand sink must be supplied with an adequate supply of soap and paper towels, and management must ensure that all staff are following proper hand washing procedures. 
Direction on hand washing methods and frequency should be outlined in the food safety plan. A policy on the proper use of gloves should also be set.</p>

                       <p>The concentration of the chlorine santizer in the glasswasher must be maintained at a minimum 100 ppm. 

All management and bar tending staff need to know how to check the wash water temperature and the sanitizer concentration of both glasswashers and how to adjust it if minimum requirements are not being met. Clear direction also needs to be outlined in the Food Safety Plan regarding all procedures that need to be followed regarding testing, and what needs to be done if a problem is identified.

A simple, but specific written sanitation plan needs to be developed for all cleaning duties that take place in all areas of the operation. Attention needs to be paid to ensuring contact times are being met- were applicable.

This will establish clear expectations for all staff, and the plan can be used as an ongoing reference and training tool.
All containers storing cleaners/chemicals must be properly labeled and no food containers are to be used for this pupose.</p>
                   
                       <p>The sanitizer concentration in the glasswasher was found at approximately 50 ppm. The unit is service one a week by a company. Bar staff did not know how to check the unit in order to ensure it is being operated according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 
The concentration was corrected at the time of inspection by the owner.

The wash water temperature gauge for the dishwasher is not operational, but at the time of inspection arrangements were made to have this replaced.

All spray bottles containing cleaning products were not labeled.
 
The use of cleaning/sanitizing products was found poor.</p>
