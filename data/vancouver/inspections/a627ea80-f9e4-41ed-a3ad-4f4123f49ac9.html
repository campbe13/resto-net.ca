THIS IS A REPEAT VIOLATION
- general poor sanitation practices continue and mice droppings again observed in wine store beneath bench seating within restaurant.

Water Pool
At the time of the revisit, dirty water was observed pooling on top of the grease trap. This will encourage pests and should now be investigated and prevented.</p>

The facility had been operating for several hours and the hot water to this sink had been turned off. Staff must have access to a dedicated hand wash station in this area at all times, if the faucet requires repairing/replacing this should now be carried out.
