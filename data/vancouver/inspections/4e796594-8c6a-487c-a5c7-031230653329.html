            <h4>
                Inadequate Cooling and/or Refrigerated Storage of Potentially Hazardous Food(s)</h4>
            
                       <p>I am very concerned about the current practice of holding potentially hazardous foods at room temperature for extended periods of time.
Pans of potentially hazardous foods such as chicken, cooked potatoes and cooked rice were observed to be held in the kitchen at room temperature.

The operator says he understands that meat is considered a potentially hazardous food but was not aware that cooked potatoes and rice are considered to be potentially hazardous.  The operator says that it has always been his practice to hold his cooked potatoes all day at room temperature.

The operator was also under the impression that as long as the food is reheated then any hazard has been eliminated.  The operator was educated on the potential of heat stable toxin production by some bacteria.  The toxin produced will not be destroyed by cooking or reheating.</p>
                   
                       <p>Store potentially hazardous foods in the cooler at 4 C or below or in the hot holding unit at 60 C or above.

Food stored above 4 C and below 60 C may allow the rapid growth of pathogenic organisms which increases the likelihood of causing a food borne illness in consumers.

Operator must ensure compliance with Section 14(2) of B.C. Reg. 210/99: "Every operator of food premises must ensure that potentially hazardous food is stored or displayed at a temperature of not more than 4�C".

WARNING:  Failure to comply with Section 14(2) of the Food Premises Regulations may result in a violation ticket being issued ($345).</p>

Ensure compliance with Section 21 of the Food Premises 
21(3)  Every operator of food premises must ensure that each employee washes his or her hands as often as necessary to prevent the contamination of food. 

21(4)  Every operator of food premises must supply and maintain handwashing stations adequate in number and location to ensure convenient access to all employees.

                       <p>A paper towel dispenser has been installed above the hand washing sink in the kitchen.  Thank you.

The operator was observed to have contaminated hands after touching the grease trap that had been leaking and was being emptied at the time of the inspection.  Instead of washing his hands properly at the kitchen hand washing station the operator was observed to wipe his hands off on his apron.  This failure to properly wash hands was discussed with the operator immediately after it was observed.

Hands must always be properly washed after any potential contamination.</p>

                       <p>Signs of a rodent infestation were again observed during the inspection.  Mouse droppings were observed in a number of locations.

The operator says he has obtained help with the rodent problem from a pest control company who have already filled some holes found behind the cooking equipment.  The operator plans to pest proof the rear door and install a shelf in the hallway to raise all items off the floor at least 6" to facilitate cleaning and pest control activities.</p>
                   
                       <p>The restaurant owner is not currently receiving copies of the pest control reports.  Ensure that the pest control company is providing a written explanation of what services were done, what pest activity was noted, and recommendations for further reducing/eliminating pest activity.  Keep these reports on site.

The operator must comply with section 26 of the Food Premises Regulations:
Every operator of food premises must ensure that the premises are 
(a) free of pests,
(b) free of conditions that lead to the harbouring or breeding of pests, and
(c) protected against the entrance of pests.</p>
