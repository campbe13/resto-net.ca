The business is required by law to have an up to date Food Safety Plan that details how food is safely handled from receipt to sale or consumption.  This plan must include the identification of critical control points (CCPs) and critical control limits (CCLs) which must be monitored daily and documented.  The plan must describe the process followed to ensure adherence to the critical limits, and the actions to be taken in the event that the critical limits are not adhered to.
The Food Premises Regulation (B.C. Reg. 210/99) section 23 requires that: "every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment."</p>
