The food establishment must have a suitable thermometer for confirming and measuring the effectiveness of the secondary cook step.
Following the secondary cooking step the sliced meat should be either:
a) used immediately to prepare donairs, or
b) stored in a hot holding unit at 60�C or greater, or
c) cooled quickly to 4�C (40�F) or colder for storage.
Cool from 60�C (140�F) to 20�C (68�F) or colder within 2 hours, and then from 20�C (68�F) to 4�C (40�F) or colder within 4 hours.
At the end of the business day, partially cooked cones MUST NOT be kept intact for future use.
