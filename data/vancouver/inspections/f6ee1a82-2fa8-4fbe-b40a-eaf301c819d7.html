Failure to comply with the Food premises regulation may result in the issuance of one or more violation tickets, having your permit revoked, closure and/or court action.</p>
                   
                       <p>FINAL WARNING, REPEAT INFRACTION:
No sanitizer solution was available in a spray bottle or in a rag bucket at the time of inspection. The owner had a cleaning product that contained bleach in it, however the bottle was nearly empty and was not sufficient for sanitizing food contact surfaces. A container of bleach was available on-site at the time of inspection.
Direction on how to prepare the sanitizer solution has been given on previous reports.</p>

                       <p>Observed clutter and unused items stored in the upstairs area. The owner stated that he only uses the upstairs storage area for the storage of cups and coffee at the ledge of the storage area. Explained to the owner that all the clutter in the upstairs storage location creates a potential nesting area for pests. In order to monitor for rodent activity the upstairs area must be organized and clutter-free. Owner stated that he has fallen from the upstair area and does not want to injure himself again. Discussed situation with both the owner of Cafe Orca and with the hotel manager. The owner claims that the items, other than the coffee and cups, do not belong to him and was not placed in that space by him. The hotel manager explained that the upstair area was created by the previous tenant. Determining who is responsible for removing the items will be left up to the two parties. Suggested to hire a professional to remove all the unnecessary items from this area.

Owner has agreed not to use this storage area.</p>

Observed floor/wall coving placed around the perimeter of the two-compartment sink. The strips were laid down over one another and has tiny pieces added in to fill the gaps. Floor/wall coving is not an acceptable material to be used on the counter around the sink. The material must be smooth, continuous, impervious to moisture and washable. 

Confirmed with the hotel management that the structural items located in the cafe are under the responsibility of the operator of Cafe Orca. The hotel managment is only responsible for the exterior walls. The owner of Cafe Orca has agreed to contact a contractor to replace the worn counter top around the two-compartment sink. Explained that the counter top around the coffee area must also be replaced in the near future, however the counter space around the two-compartment sink is of higher priority.</p>
                   
                       <p>> Remove the floor/wall coving around the two-compartment sink
