            Request for routine inspection for re-opening after a closure. Inspection conducted at 4pm. Accompanied by Mark Teng.

The sanitation of the premise is still unsatisfactory at this time. Still some corrective actions on the inspection report are not complete.
- observed a considerable amount of grease and food debris under the deep frying area, along the sides of the wall, down the wall (sides and back), the ventilation plates were dripping with grease, pooling grease and food debris underneath the area.
- cove base missing from the sides of the deep frying area and pooling grease and food debris trapped in between floor and wall.
- rodent droppings in cabinet near cooling equipment in front counter area and women's washroom.
- food containers visibly unclean, steamed rice container with a crack (with growing mold) - to be discarded
- exposed holes in washrooms still unfilled
- curtains require cleaning. 
- raw meat still stored above ready-to-eat foods
- hot water supply at 2-compartment sink was luke warm
- open bag of rice on shelving not in a pest proof container

Items in compliance:
- thermometers in all cooling units
- dishwasher final rinse temperature measured at the plate was 71.4 degrees C today
- front handsink cleanliness is better
- no potentially hazardous foods were stored at ambient temperatures (or between 4-60 degrees C).

A hand-written copy of this report was provided to the Operator.

Health Approval to re-open was not granted.

Again, all corrective actions listed on the closure order and inspection report must be completed in full.

Section 23 (2) of the BC Food Premise Regulation states that: Every operator of a food service establishment must have written procedures to ensure that a health hazard does not occur in the operation of the establishment.

(a) identification of all critical control points,
(b) critical limits for those critical control points,
(c) the procedures to be followed to ensure adherence to the critical limits, and
(d) the actions to be taken in the event that the critical limits are not adhered to.</p>

                Improper Sanitary Facilities</h4>
            
                       <p>1. 2-comp sink in the kitchen (used for kitchen staff hand washing) lacked hot water at the time of the inspection and single-use paper towels in a dispenser. The sink was also covered in an accumulation of food debris.
2. Handsink in front counter area not maintained in sanitary manner and used for other purpose other than hand washing.

Handwashing is the single most effective method to prevent the transmission of any disease. Hand washing must include washing with warm water, liquid soap, rinsing and properly drying using papertowels. Providing this equipment ensures foodhandlers are able to properly wash their hands to prevent contamination of foods.</p>
                   
                       <p>All handwashing stations must be fully equipped with hot/cold running water, liquid soap and papertowels in a dispenser. Hand sinks must be maintained in a sanitary manner and dedicated solely to hand washing (at lease one-compartment of the 2-comp sink). Train staff on proper handwashing procedures. This includes: frequency, the use of designated handsinks, and method. 

Note: the Owner must ensure that supply of hot and cold water is adequate in quantity and pressure to meet the water needs of the food premises at all times when in operation.</p>

                       <p>Rodent droppings observed on the floor in the front sushi counter area.</p>
                   
                       <p>The presence of rodents or insects must be treated immediately by: 
1. Inspecting and discarding any adulterated food
2. Cleaning and sanitizing surfaces contaminated by pests (i.e. by using 1000ppm diluted bleach). 
3. Cleaning and santizing areas with food debris and grease on a daily basis
4. Protecting the food premises against the entrance of pests - seal all gaps and holes.
5. Removing all unnecessary clutter.
6. Enlisting in the services of a pest control company if you do not have a contract. 
7. A sanitation plan from the Operator will be required which will outline pest control measures that will be taken on a daily basis. Note: pest control companies are not responsible for daily monitoring, cleaning, sanitizing, and removal of pest activity. This is the Owner's responsibility.</p>

                       <p>A thorough cleaning and sanititzing of the premise is required with particular attention to (but not limited) to items listed above. All surfaces must be smooth, impervious, and easy to clean and maintained in a sanitary manner.</p>
                   
                       <p>Insanitary conditions observed:
1. Grease covering the fumehood, slates, and dripping down the walls - recommended a professional clean.
2. Food debris and grease trapped in between broken cove base and wall/floor junction - repair broken cove base
3. Debris under the dishwasher - broken floor tiles - repair broken tiles
4. Grease on the front of the up-right cooler in the back.
5. Cardboard lining the floors in the front counter area - this is not a suitable finish. 
6. Accumulation of food debris and rodent droppings in the front counter area on the floor.</p>

>Some holes in walls were observed that must be repaired.  These holes may provide rodents access into the restaurant.

A hole was observed behind the metal table beside cooking equipment.
A hole was observed near the floor opposite the sushi area sink.

>The rear door has a gap beneath that may be large enough to allow small mice access.  There is no screen door in place.  Unless a tightly fitting screen door is in place to prevent pest entry, the rear door should remain closed.

>Base boards were observed to be missing from several areas of wall.  Re-install base boards to prevent damage to the walls from routine cleaning activities.

>The fluorescent light fixtures did not have covers in place.  Please replace the covers.</p>
