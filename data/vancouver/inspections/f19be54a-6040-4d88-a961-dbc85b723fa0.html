Otherwise, store utensils in ice water to keep the temperature of the solution below 4 degrees C.</p>

                       <p>Resolved - did not observe cooked chicken in the prep inserts not properly cooled down after cooking. All potentially hazardous foods that have been cooked must be properly cooked (i.e. to 74 degrees C) and then properly cooled and refrigerated (i.e. from 60 C (140F) to 20 C (68F) or less within two hours and then from 20 C (68F) to 4 C (40F) or less within 4 hours) prior to re-heating to 74 degrees C (165 degrees F) or above. Half cooking potentially hazardous food is a high risk practice.

These requirements must be reflected in your Food Safety Plan.</p>

Providing the proper equipment ensures foodhandlers are able to properly wash their hands to prevent contamination of foods. A proper hand wash consists of: vigorously rubbing together the surfaces of the lathered hands and exposed arms with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds followed by a thorough rinsing with warm clean water.

                       <p>Again, rodent droppings observed amongst food containers and cutting boards on a shelf under the dishwashing area and on the floor behind the up-right cooler.
Did not observe rodent droppings on shelving next to chopping knives, on the floor in the staff washroom, and on the floor in the women's washroom. 

This is now the fourth consecutive inspection where rodent droppings have been observed at this premise. Staff claim that they have a pest control contract.

Note: pest control companies are not responsible for the DAILY cleaning, sanitizing, inspection for droppings, and removal of droppings when observed. This is the Owner's responsibility.</p>
                   
                       <p>Owner/Operator must:
1. Inspect and discard any adulterated food (including foods in open containers).
2. Clean and sanitize surfaces contaminated by pests (i.e. by using 1000ppm diluted bleach). Remove all items off of shelving and sanitize shelving and food containers.
3. Remove all food debris and grease from inside and outside the premises on a daily basis
4. Protecting the food premises against the entrance of pests - seal all gaps and holes (move shelving away from walls and fill holes in wall, flooring, and ceiling). Destroy and seal off nests and breeding places.
5. Remove all unnecessary clutter.
6. An updated sanitation plan from the Operator will be required which will outline pest control measures that will be taken on a daily basis.</p>

Blackening wall and floor tiles under the dishwashing area and food debris accumulating behind the right side of the dishwasher along the wall adjacent to the staff washroom.
2. Weather strip for backdoor required however, the strip is too short leaving a gap underneath the door that may allow the entrance of pests.</p>
                   
                       <p>1. Cleaning is required in hard to reach areas (i.e. under dishwasher, around hot water tank, back of prep cooler, behind/around deepfryer, and in the track of the up-right glass cooler).
2. Install a proper weatherstrip along the bottom of the back door to close the gap.</p>
