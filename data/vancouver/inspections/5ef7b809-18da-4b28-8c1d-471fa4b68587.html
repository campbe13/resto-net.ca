> build up of flour and rice on floors under shelves
> several open bags of dry ingredients sitting directly on floor
> many items sitting on floors instead of being stored on shelves
> personal items stored amongst food items on the same shelves
> lights against the back wall were not working - room is dim

These conditions may attract pests by serving as food source and harborage if not corrected.</p>
                   
                       <p>> Clean indicated areas. Include in sanitation plan that this area will be cleaned at least once a week or whenever there is a spill of flour, rice or other foods.
> Store dry ingredients such as rice and flour in pest resistant containers, and containers must be securely closed when not in use. 
> Keep items at least 6" off flour (except for large flour bins and plastic buckets) to allow easy access for cleaning. Ensure large containers are pulled out when cleaning areas around and underneath.
> Organize shelves and ensure personal items are stored distinctively separated from food items.
> Repair lights. Adequate lighting is required for proper cleaning.</p>
