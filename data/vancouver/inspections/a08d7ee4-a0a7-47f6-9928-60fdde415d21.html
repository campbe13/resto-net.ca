Devise and implement a Food Safety Plan. Provide a copy to the EHO early next year.</p>

                       <p>1. Corrected at the time of inspection. Wiping cloths were placed in a solution of >100ppm chlorine. Store dirty/wet wiping cloths in sanitizer solution when not in use to prevent microbial growth and thus, prevent contamination of food contact surfaces. Sanitizer solution can consist of 100ppm Cl or 200ppm quats in buckets. Refesh solution throughout the day to ensure concentration is adequate.

2. Prepare a diluted bleach solution (1tsp bleach per litre of water) in a spray bottle (one for each area of the premise) for sanitizing food contact surfaces throughout the day to prevent contamination of foods. A sanitizer must be available at all times when in operation. Ensure sanitizer is applied for 2 minutes contact time after washing. Label all containers containing chemicals.</p>
                   
                       <p>1. Wiping cloths used to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces not stored properly (e.g. sanitizing solution not used). Wiping cloths provide the optimal conditions for microbial growth. Using these cloths to wipe food contact surfaces without being stored in sanitizer may contaminate food.

2. Lack of approved sanitizer at the time of inspection. Premise equipped with bleach but no sanitizer (i.e. bleach and diluted water) was available.</p>

Ensure the final rinse temperature is adequate for sanitizing at all times.

                       <p>Some cleaning and sanitizing of the premise is required. Observed:
1. Grease and food debris under and around the deep fryer area. This is re-occurring from the last routine inspection. 
2. Food debris on shelving throughout the premise. Some walls also require cleaning.
3. Grease and food debris on the outside of equipment, inside 2-comp sink.
4. Clean and dirty utensils are being stored together. Clean utensils stored in a bin that is visibly unclean.
5. Dust on the inside of the walk-in cooler (i.e. on the ceiling)</p>
                   
                       <p>- Conduct a thorough cleaning of underneath, beside and behind deep fryer.  
- Clean-up accumulating food debris and wash walls
- Clean and sanitize the outside and inside of equipment.
- Designate a separate storage area for clean and dirty utensils and equipment. Store clean/sanitized dishes and utensils in a sanitary manner.
- Clean dust on inside of walk-in cooler (ensure food stored in the cooler is protected from contamination while cleaning).

Continue to clean and sanitize the premises on a daily basis. A sanitation plan will be required early next year. Resources provided.</p>

                       <p>- Fill exposed holes with dry wall, insulation foam, or steel wool to prevent the entrance of pests.
- Bare wood surfaces must be finished with a smooth surface. Finish bare wood with a high gloss paint or wood sealant or find an alternative material other than wood that is easy to clean. 
- Remove duct tape from surfaces as this is not a cleanable material
- Repair broken tiles and deteriorating walls so surfaces are smooth and easy to clean.
- Refresh silicone behind sinks.
- Remove all unnecessary items from the premise to eliminate clutter (this makes it easier to monitor for signs of pest activity)</p>
                   
                       <p>Some maintenance is required. Observed:
1. A hole in the wall near front sushi counter with debris.
2. Bare wood poll used behind cutting boards in the sushi prep area and duct tape lining shelving.
3. Broken tiles along the wall and drywall in disrepair (i.e. near the 2-comp sink.
4. Silicone was deteriorating and blackening behind most sinks (i.e. staff washroom, 2-comp, dishwasher sink, 1-comp near deep fryer).
Note: back storage room is a bit cluttered.

All surfaces must be smooth, impervious and easy to clean.</p>
