>Cutting boards (or other food contact surfaces) must be cleaned and sanitized (using the bleach solution or another approved sanitizer) after use.   
>Clean and sanitize cutting boards or other equipment at least every four hours when they are under the same continuous use.

Hold wiping cloths fully immersed in a bucket of sanitizing solution when not being actively used.</p>
