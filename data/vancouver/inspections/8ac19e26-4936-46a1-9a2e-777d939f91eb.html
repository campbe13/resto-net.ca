                       <p>*Exterior access points that require correction/improvement to ensure a tight fitting seal:
-East exit door, near main bar is not adequately sealed at bottom to prevent rodent/insect entry.
-West side exit door (sign on exterior reads "Hy's executive offices") is not adequately sealed at bottom to prevent rodent/insect entry.
-Door to front baloncy is not adequately sealed at bottom to prevent rodent/insect entry.
-Exit door on west side fire escape (in the private dining room on 2nd floor) is not adequately sealed at bottom to prevent rodent/insect entry.

*Holes/access points within the facility that require repairs to enclose:
-holes in wall underneath main bar, under bar well.
-crevice noted in corner under main dishwasher in kitchen.
-significant sized spacing around pipes under the dishpit.
-hole noted just above tiled baseboard in corner of kitchen between grill and 2-comparment sink.</p>
                   
                       <p>Met with pest control operator, Barry, from Ecolab to review ongoing rodent issues.  Mouse infestation appears to be decreasing significantly and problem is becoming controllable. No live or dead mice noted during this time.  Ecolab representative informs that they were onsite earlier and inspected all the traps, total of 7 were caught since their last visit which is significantly reduced since they were contracted to deal with the problem.  Conducted a walk about with Ecolab rep and Scott, General Manager to identify further improvements needed as noted below.</p>

-The main bar has accumulated debris, dirt, grime, etc on the floor, particularly underneath equipment, sinks, bar well, etc.  ITEM OUTSTANDING FROM PREVIOUS INSPECTION.

                       <p>*Replace missing light cover under fume hood to prevent potential broken glass contamination of food or food contact surfaces in kitchen.
*Cause all necessary repairs to be completed of floor in the front food prep area.  Ensure that broken/missing tiles are replaced and entire area re-grouted.  Work must be done correctly to ensure proper drainage to floor drain.
*Make repairs to the pasta cold holding unit so that it does not leak.
*Make adjustments/repairs to the glass washer so it does not spray water on the floor.</p>
                   
                       <p>-Missing light cover noted under fume hood in kitchen.

ITEMS OUTSTANDING FROM PREVIOUS INSPECTION:
-Floor within front prep area is deteriorating.  Significant amount of broken or missing tiles and lack of grout noted.  This disrepair is causing water and food debris to collect in spaces where tile/grout is lacking and floor cannot be properly cleaned.  Disrepair is also prohibiting proper drainage into the floor drain in this area.  Additionally, these problems can provide a food/water source for rodents/insects.
-The cold holding unit for the pasta is leaking, contributing to the water ponding in the front food prep area.
-The bar glass washer is spraying water on the floor and shelves.</p>
